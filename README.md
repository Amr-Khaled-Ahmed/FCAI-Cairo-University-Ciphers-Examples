# 🔐 Cipher and Decipher Application
## 📖 Overview
A Cipher and Decipher Application using 10 different methods to encrypt and decrypt messages using C++.

## 🔑 Featured Ciphers and Deciphers


- A. Atbash 
- B. Baconian 
- C. Polybius Square 
- D. Simple Substitution 
- E. Rail Fence 
- F. Route 
- G. Vignere 
- H. XOR

## ✨ Program Features
- The program starts with a welcome message, then asks to choose between different types of ciphers, then chooses to cipher or dcipher, then enters the phrase that he wants to perform.
- Each encryption/decryption type has its own characteristics, so each encryption/decryption type verifies the validity of the statement as it should be.
- After encryption/decryption the message is shown to the user.
