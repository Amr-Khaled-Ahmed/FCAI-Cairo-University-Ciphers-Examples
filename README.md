# FCAI-Cairo-University-Ciphers-Deciphers
<div align='center'>


This repository was created by Amr Khaled, Youssef Amgad, and Mohamed Ahmed to apply Ciphers Examples.

## Ciphers Examples


- A. Atbash Cipher
- B. Baconian Cipher
- C. Polybius Square Cipher
- D. Simple Substitution Cipher
- E. Rail Fence Cipher
- F. Route Cipher
- G. Vignere Cipher
- H. XOR Cipher
- I. Affine Cipher
- J. Morse Cipher
 


## Program Features
- The program starts with a welcome message, then asks to choose between different types of ciphers, then chooses to cipher or dcipher, then enters the phrase that he wants to perform.
- Each encryption type has its own characteristics, so each encryption type verifies the validity of the statement as it should be
